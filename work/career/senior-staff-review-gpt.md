Below is a **structured, manager-ready summary** you can use in your discussion, plus a **gap analysis** and **growth plan** tailored to your comments.
I’ve intentionally written it in a tone that fits 1:1 conversations about growth and performance—clear, honest, mature, not defensive, and showing initiative.

If you'd like, I can also turn this into a **slide**, **Notion page**, or **short written self-evaluation**.

# 🌟 **Senior → Staff Readiness Review**

### **Self-Assessment Across Senior & Staff Expectations**

---

## **1. Senior Expectations — My Current Standing**

### **Domain Expertise & System Understanding**

**Strengths**

* ~7 years experience; strong command of my core domain (Frontend, partners integration, growth surfaces, etc.).
* Good understanding of HoneyBook’s infrastructure and relevant systems.
* Exposure to multiple areas: setup, signup, email composer, tasks, membership, promotions, referrals, marketing surfaces.

**Areas to Improve**

* Expand knowledge of more Commandos and deeper backend/system interactions.
* Strengthen business & user understanding (I understand it, but want to be more fluent at connecting technical decisions → product impact).

---

### **Execution & Ownership**

**Strengths**

* Confident with end-to-end execution for small → large tasks.
* Handle cross-functional and external communication well (comfortable collaborating across Growth & infra teams).
* Follow through after launch, including monitoring and evaluating outcomes.

**Areas to Improve**

* More proactive monitoring & instrumentation after shipping.
* Increase test coverage, especially E2E/acceptance tests after encountering production issues.

---

### **Collaboration, Technical Discussions & Mentorship**

**Strengths**

* Comfortable resolving disagreements within my scope when needed.
* Mentor junior engineers and help teammates.
* Participate in planning and designing initiatives.

**Areas to Improve**

* Be more proactive in identifying issues outside my assigned tasks.
* Expand contributions to team-wide conventions, shared tooling, and best practices.
* Provide more consistent feedback (not only in PRs or peer reviews).
* Step more into difficult technical discussions—not just when I already know the area well.

---

## **2. Staff Expectations — Gap Analysis**

### **Deep Domain, Systems & Architecture Knowledge**

**Where I stand**

* Strong understanding of systems I interact with; can navigate them and find my way.
* Not yet at the “deep understanding of all related systems and dependencies” level expected from Staff.

**Gap**

* Architectural depth across domains.
* Anticipating system-wide implications without needing to explore reactively.

---

### **Architecting & Leading Large-Scale Solutions**

**Where I stand**

* Haven’t yet architected or led multi-team, large-scale solutions.
* Haven’t been the decision-maker for cross-domain technical debates.

**Gap**

* Need opportunities (or need to seek them proactively) to lead larger, multi-team initiatives.
* Build experience presenting architectural proposals, leading discussions, and influencing decisions.

---

### **Organizational Influence (Systems, Process, Roadmaps)**

**Where I stand**

* Not currently creating team-wide roadmaps, tech-debt strategies, or long-term plans.
* Not involved in vendor-related decisions or cross-team processes.

**Gap**

* Increase influence beyond my squad:

  * Tech guilds
  * Shared tooling
  * Creating conventions
  * Leading technical initiatives

---

### **Mentorship & Raising the Bar**

**Where I stand**

* Support juniors when asked.
* Provide PR feedback.

**Gap**

* Need to operate more consistently as a mentor.
* Provide tough, constructive, direct feedback more often.
* Identify performance issues early (within engineering or processes).
* Help others level up intentionally, not just incidentally.

---

### **Ambiguous Areas / Points I Need Clarified by Manager**

Here are the items you mentioned were unclear—good questions to bring:

1. **“Involved in external groups and projects in their domain”**

   * Does this mean industry communities, open source, cross-company initiatives, or internal groups outside my squad?

2. **“A good fit for advising other companies”**

   * Is this literal (consulting style) or metaphorical (having expertise that could be generalizable externally)?

3. **“Track and monitor systems, assign actions”**

   * Does this refer to leading post-mortems? Ongoing health monitoring of a domain? Operational responsibility?

4. **“Low performance—improve or separate”**

   * What’s the scope for a Staff engineer in performance management vs. a manager’s responsibility?

5. **Expectations around guild leadership**

   * What level of ownership do Staff engineers hold for guild standards, cross-team conventions, tooling, etc.?

---

# 🔍 **Summary: Where I Stand Today**

### **As a Senior:**

✔️ *I meet most expectations.*
🔧 *Remaining gaps are around deeper business focus, broader domain awareness, giving more feedback, and flagging issues outside my immediate scope.*

### **As a Staff Candidate:**

⚠️ *I currently meet only a subset of Staff expectations.*
My biggest gaps are:

* Architectural leadership
* Cross-team influence and responsibility
* Creating conventions, tooling, and roadmaps
* Deepening multi-domain system knowledge
* Being a consistent technical mentor and thought partner across teams—not just within my own workstream

---

# 🚀 **My Growth Plan Toward Staff**

### **1. Technical Depth & Breadth**

* Pick 1–2 systems adjacent to my domain and become the “go-to” person.
* Participate in architecture discussions (even if not leading yet).
* Shadow Staff engineers on large projects when possible.

### **2. Lead a Cross-Team Technical Initiative**

Examples:

* Create a shared frontend tooling improvement.
* Own a Performance/Monitoring initiative across Growth surfaces.
* Lead improvements in partner integrations architecture (this fits your ongoing work).

### **3. Increase Mentorship & Influence**

* Hold structured mentoring sessions with 1–2 juniors/mids.
* Participate actively in the FE Guild with proposals, demos, or guidelines.
* Give more frequent dispassionate, actionable feedback.

### **4. Improve System Ownership & Monitoring**

* Build dashboards/alerts for systems you own.
* Introduce post-release checklists and testing routines.
* Lead postmortems for issues related to your domain.

### **5. Visibility & Communication**

* Write more architectural docs and RFCs.
* Present solutions to broader engineering.
* Communicate proactively about risks and opportunities beyond your tasks.

# 📝 **Short, Manager-Ready Summary (you can copy/paste)**

> **I reviewed the Senior and Staff expectations and I believe I'm strong on most Senior competencies—especially execution, ownership, communication, domain expertise, and collaboration. I identified a few Senior areas where I’d like to improve, mainly around deeper business understanding, stronger monitoring/testing habits, and being more proactive at spotting issues beyond my immediate scope.**
>
> **For Staff expectations, I see that I'm currently meeting some foundational elements but still have meaningful growth areas. Specifically:**
>
> * **Gaining deeper architectural understanding of system-wide concerns**
> * **Leading large, multi-team initiatives end-to-end**
> * **Influencing engineering through standards, tooling, conventions**
> * **Being a cross-team technical mentor and go-to decision-maker**
> * **Becoming more active in the guild or broader engineering community**
>
> **I’d love to align with you on a concrete growth plan and understand which opportunities exist where I can practice Staff-level responsibilities. I also have questions about a few of the descriptions to ensure I interpret them correctly.**

If you'd like, I can also:
✅ turn this into a polished one-pager
✅ rephrase it in a more formal or more casual tone
✅ create a bullet list version for your self-review system
✅ help you prepare questions to ask your manager
✓ or simulate the manager’s perspective and critique

Would you like me to refine this further or format it into something you can share directly?
