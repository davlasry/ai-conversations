### Areas to Strengthen (Senior Level)

| Area | Current State | Action Ideas |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **"Look beyond my screen"** | Not consistently identifying issues outside direct task scope | Actively scan for blockers, risks, or opportunities that affect team/project even if not my task |
| **Proactive feedback** | Mostly limited to PR reviews and formal peer review cycles | Find opportunities for timely, constructive feedback outside formal channels |
| **Monitoring & testing** | Want to improve post-deployment monitoring and E2E test coverage | Build habit of adding tests when fixing production bugs |

## Staff Role: Gap Analysis

### Not Yet Doing / Need Opportunity

| Expectation | Current State | Discussion Point |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Deep understanding of system-wide concerns | Surface-level awareness; know where to look but not always deep | How can I get more exposure here? |
| Plan/design/guide complex multi-team solutions | No opportunity yet | What projects might allow me to grow here? |
| Final decision-maker on technical debates | Not in this position | How do I build toward this authority? |
| Create technology/technical roadmap | Not doing this | Could I start with a smaller scope? |
| Track/monitor systems, assign action items | No | What would this look like for my domain? |
| External groups/projects involvement | Not currently involved | Are there opportunities I should pursue? |
| Create practices/conventions/tooling for team | Do my own optimizations but don't share broadly | Start documenting and sharing what works |

### Minimal Involvement
- Frontend guild participation (but limited influence)
- Some cross-team awareness through domain ownership changes

## Questions for My Manager

### Clarification Questions
1. **"Advising/consulting other companies"** - What does this mean in practice? Is this about external consulting or internal cross-team advisory?

2. **"Low performance"** - Does this refer to system performance issues, or team member performance? What's the expectation here?

3. **Vendor/contract management** - Is this expected for all Staff engineers or specific to certain roles?

### Growth & Opportunity Questions
4. How do you see my current standing relative to Senior expectations?

5. What are the 2-3 most important areas I should focus on to prepare for Staff?

6. Are there upcoming projects or initiatives where I could get exposure to multi-team technical leadership?

7. How can I get more involved in technical roadmap discussions for my domain?

8. What does "creating practices and tooling for the team" look like in practice? Should I be driving this proactively?

## Proposed Focus Areas (Draft)

Based on my self-assessment, potential priorities to discuss:

**Short-term (solidify Senior)**
1. Be more proactive about identifying issues outside my direct tasks
2. Give more timely, constructive feedback to teammates
3. Improve monitoring and testing habits

**Medium-term (bridge to Staff)**
1. Seek opportunities to lead or architect multi-team solutions
2. Start contributing to technical roadmap discussions
3. Share my tooling/practices more broadly with the team
4. Deepen system-wide technical knowledge
